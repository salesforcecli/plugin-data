# summary

Import data from one or more JSON files into an org.

# description

The JSON files that contain the data are in sObject tree format, which is a collection of nested, parent-child records with a single root record. Use the "<%= config.bin %> data export tree" command to generate these JSON files.

If you used the --plan flag when exporting the data to generate a plan definition file, use the --plan flag to reference the file when you import. If you're not using a plan, use the --files flag to list the files. If you specify multiple JSON files that depend on each other in a parent-child relationship, be sure you list them in the correct order.

# flags.files.summary

Comma-separated and in-order JSON files that contain the records, in sObject tree format, that you want to insert.

# flag.files.description

Each file can contain up to 200 total records. For more information, see the REST API Developer Guide. (https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite_sobject_tree.htm)

# flags.plan.summary

Plan definition file to insert multiple data files.

# flags.plan.description

Unlike the `--files` flag, the files listed in the plan definition file **can** contain more then 200 records. These will be automatically batched to comply with that limit.

The file order matters--records with lookups to records in another file should be listed AFTER that file Example: you're loading Account and Contact records, and the contacts have references to those Accounts. The Accounts file should come before the Contacts file.

The plan definition file has the following schema:

- items(object) - SObject Type: Definition of records to be insert per SObject Type
  - sobject(string) - Name of SObject: Child file references must have SObject roots of this type
  - files(array) - Files: An array of files paths to load

# examples

- Import the records contained in two JSON files into the org with alias "my-scratch":

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --files Contact.json,Account.json --target-org my-scratch

- Import records using a plan definition file into your default org:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --plan Account-Contact-plan.json
