# summary

Deletes a single record from a Salesforce or Tooling API object.

# description

Specify the record you want to delete with either its ID or with a list of field-value pairs that identify the record. If your list of fields identifies more than one record, the delete fails; the error displays how many records were found.

When specifying field-value pairs, use the format <fieldName>=<value>. Enclose all field-value pairs in one set of double quotation marks, delimited by spaces. Enclose values that contain spaces in single quotes.

This command deletes a record from Salesforce objects by default. Use the --use-tooling-api flag to delete from a Tooling API object.

# flags.sobject

API name of the Salesforce or Tooling API object that you're deleting a record from.

# flags.recordId

ID of the record youâ€™re deleting.

# flags.where

List of <fieldName>=<value> pairs that identify the record you want to delete.

# flags.useToolingApi

Use Tooling API so you can delete a record from a Tooling API object.
